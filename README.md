### Rules

Avoid the bears while collecting watermelons. Getting watermelons increases your health. As time goes on, more bears appear on the screen. If you touch the bears, you lose health. The game ends when your health reaches zero. Try to last as long as possible. Your final score is the number of watermelons you collected.
